Finally have something working

## API
The API is basically the NodeJS + Express server using MongoDB. It uses Mongoose which is really neat.

## Client
This folder can basically be replaced by whatever you want. An Angular, React or whatever framework you want. It's currently configured to use:
 - Vue + VueRouter
 - TailwindCSS and TailwindUI
